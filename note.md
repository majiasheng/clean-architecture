# 3 paradigms
- structural
   Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
- object oriented
   Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
- functional
   Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.

each of the paradigms remove capabilities

the three paradigms are everything about architecture:
function, separation of components, and data management

we use polymorphism as the mechnism to cross architectural boundaries;

we use function programming to impose dicipline on the location of and
access to data; 

we use structured programming as the algorithmic foundation of our modules

Scientific theories and laws are *falsifiable* but not *provable*

Science does not work by proving statements true, but rather by proving statements false.

Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs. -- Dijkstra
